# Employee Payroll Application

## Summary
This Java command line application is designed to manage employee payroll by collecting work hours and calculating pay based on various conditions. The application will validate user inputs, calculate daily and total pay, and display results in a user-friendly format.

## Important Points (Deliverables)
- **Application Structure**: Implement good practices of object-oriented programming by creating appropriate classes (e.g., Employee, Payroll, Validator).
- **User Input Validation**: Ensure that user inputs for employee name and pay rate are validated according to specified requirements.
- **Daily Pay Calculation**: Develop logic to calculate daily pay based on hours worked, considering conditions such as weekends and holidays.
- **Total Pay Calculation**: Implement functionality to calculate and display the total pay for the employee after all entries are processed.
- **Code Clarity and Comments**: Write clear, well-structured code with meaningful variable names and comprehensive comments for each class, method, and significant code block.
